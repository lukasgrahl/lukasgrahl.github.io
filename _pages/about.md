Hi, my name is Lukas

I am a PhD student at Aarhus University at the Department of Economics and Business Economics under the supervision of 
[Steffen Meyer](https://steffen-meyer.net/). 

My research focuses on behaviour under ambiguity in the context of financial decision making,
some of my work is featured in [repositories](https://lukasgrahl.github.io/repositories/)

I also really like art, especially analog [photography](https://lukasgrahl.github.io/photography/)
